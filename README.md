# Vulkan Linux Learning

## Setup

Install dependencies for vulkan development from this [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux)

Skip the makefile section as this project uses cmake.

~~The build script can be modified for a different IDE (Uses CodeLite as is).~~

I'm currently using Code - OSS with the c++ and cmake extensions from this [Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux). If you are also running Arch you will need to manually install the C++ extension from Microsoft (They use a different store from what I gather).

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/rassweiler/learning-vulkan.git
```

If not using Code - OSS then run the cmake command for your generator of choice
